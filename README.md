# LiverRegenerationAtlas

This repository contains the code to replicate the analysis described in our Liver Regeneration Atlas manuscript, titled "[Multimodal Decoding of Human Liver Regeneration](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07376-2)". 
The analysis is first split by organism and methodology. 
Subfolders delineate individual lineage or whole organ datasets.
