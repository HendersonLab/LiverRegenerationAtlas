# LiverRegenerationAtlas

This repository contains the code to replicate the analysis described in our Liver Regeneration Atlas manuscript, titled "[Multimodal Decoding of Human Liver Regeneration](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.24.529873v1)". 
The analysis is first split by organism and methodology. 
Subfolders delineate individual lineage or whole organ datasets.
